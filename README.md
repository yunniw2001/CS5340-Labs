# MEMO
Important:
!!!!!!!!!
I found a mistake in lab1 factor_utils when I emplement lab2, so the code in lab 1 maybe wrong, even if it can pass all the localtest. [It is wrong, and doesn't get full marks in AS1]

Please check lab2 factor_utils, at least now it can work under both lab1's and lab2's test. [lab3 and lab4 too]
